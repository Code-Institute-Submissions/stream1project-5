                <p> Djerba is the largest island in North Africa. 
                Its multicultural residents are famously friendly, 
                and the island itself is a kaleidoscope of whitewashed buildings, 
                sandy beaches and colorful seafood restaurants.
                Some visitors spend their time relaxing in luxury hotels along the Zone Touristique beachfront,
                while others venture into the Houmt Souk medina in search of authentic souvenirs.

                <h2>Hwange National Park</h2>
                <p>
                   Located to the west of the country on the border with Botswana,
                   Hwange National Park is the oldest and largest of Zimbabwe game reserves. 
                   It covers a vast expanse of around 5,655 square miles/ 14,650 square kilometers,
                   and provides a refuge for over 100 species of mammal - including the Big Five. 
                   It is most famous for its elephants.
                   In fact, the Hwange elephant population is thought to be one of the largest in the world.
                   The park is also home to some of Africa rarest safari animals, 
                   including the African wild dog, the brown hyena and the critically endangered black Rhino.

                <h2>Robben Island</h2>
                <p>
                  Surrounded by the frigid waters of Table Bay, 
                  Robben Island was once a penal colony for political prisoners.
                  Legendary South African president Nelson Mandela spent 18 years here during his apartheid-era imprisonment; 
                  as did many other important political revolutionaries. 
                  Half-day Robben Island tours depart from Cape Town's V&A Waterfront,
                  and offer you an insight into what life in the prison would have been like.
                  Led by former prisoners, the tours include a return ferry ride to the island, 
                  a tour of the island itself and a visit to the old cells (including one inhabited by
                  Nelson Mandela).

                <h2>Majorelle Gardens</h2>
                <p>
                    Situated northwest of the medina, 
                    the Majorelle Gardens are an easy 30-minute walk from the city center. 
                    They are filled with rare plants and an overwhelming sense of peace that comes as a welcome antidote to the chaos of the souks. 
                    Designed by Jacques Majorelle, a French painter who settled in Marrakesh in 1919, 
                    the gardens were purchased by Pierre Berg√© and Yves Saint Laurent in 1980 and restored to their original glory. 
                    Majorelle's garden workshop is now a small museum dedicated to Islamic art.
                    The gardens are popular, and the best time to visit is in the early morning before the crowds arrive.
